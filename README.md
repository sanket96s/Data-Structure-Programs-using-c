<h1>Data structures</h1>

1. **array.c**: This C program enables users to insert, display, and delete elements from an array. It utilizes a menu-driven interface for user interaction, allowing them to perform these operations conveniently. 💪📊

2. **bubbleSort.c**: The provided C program sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. It prompts the user to input the number of elements and then the elements themselves. After sorting the elements in ascending order, it displays the sorted array. 🛁🔄

3. **circularDoublyLinkedList.c**: This C program implements a doubly linked list with add, delete, and display functionalities. It offers a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the list, allowing them to manipulate nodes and view the list's contents. 🔄🔗

4. **circularLinkedList.c**: This C program implements a circular singly linked list with functionalities to create nodes, display the list, add nodes at specified positions, and delete nodes from specified positions. It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface allowing users to interact with the linked list. The program continues executing until the user chooses to end it. 🔄🔗

9. **circularQueue.c**: The provided C code implements a circular queue using an array. It includes functions for enqueueing, dequeueing, peeking, and displaying elements, all controlled by a menu-driven interface. 🔄🧑‍🤝‍🧑

5. **doublyLinkedList.c**: This C program implements a doubly linked list with basic operations such as creating nodes, displaying the list, adding nodes at specified positions, and deleting nodes from specified positions. It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface allowing users to perform these operations on the linked list. 🔗🔄

6. **hashTableUsingArray.c**: This C program implements a hash table using quadratic probing for collision resolution. Users can insert and search for data in the hash table via a menu-driven interface. Quadratic probing ensures efficient handling of collisions, enabling quick insertion and retrieval of data within the specified hash table size. 🗝️🏡

7. **infixToPostfix.c**: The provided C code converts infix expressions to postfix expressions using a stack-based algorithm. It parses the input infix expression character by character, handling operators and parentheses while maintaining proper precedence. The resulting postfix expression is displayed as output. ➡️🔄

8. **multipleParenthesisBalancing.c**: This C program checks the validity of parentheses in a user-input expression. It utilizes a stack to track opening parentheses and ensures matching pairs are present. The result indicates whether the expression is valid or not. ⚖️👥

9. **postfixExpressionEvaluation.c**: The provided C program evaluates a postfix expression using a stack-based approach. It parses the expression character by character, pushing operands onto the stack and performing operations when encountering operators. Finally, it prints the result of the expression evaluation. ➡️🔢

10. **queueUsingArray.c**: This C program implements a basic queue data structure using arrays. It allows enqueue, dequeue, peek, and display operations on the queue. 🔄📦

11. **queueUsingLinkedList.c**: This C program implements a queue using a linked list. It allows enqueue, dequeue, peek, and display operations on the queue. 🔗🔄

12. **stackUsingArray.c**: This C program implements a stack data structure with push, pop, peak, and display operations. It utilizes an array-based approach, allowing the user to interactively perform stack operations via a menu-driven interface. 🔄📚

13. **stackUsingLinkedList.c**: This C program implements a stack using a linked list. It allows users to create, push, pop, display, and peek at elements in the stack. The user interacts with the stack through a menu-driven interface, providing flexibility in stack operations. 🔗🔄

14. **singleLinkedList.c**: This C program creates a singly linked list and allows users to add, delete, and display nodes. It offers a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction and terminates upon user request. 🔗📁
